# Quickstart

Observation Tools helps you quickly inspect complex data without needing to build your own visualization tools.

Integrating Observation Tools into your program takes about 5 minutes. You need to:

1. Create a project
2. Install a client library
3. Export your data
5. Visualize your data

### Organizing your data

We use four different concepts to organize your data:

- **Artifacts** are individual pieces of data, e.g. an image
- **Artifact groups** help organize artifacts and can define how artifacts can be visualized together.
- **Runs** are the top level artifact groups. The normally correspond to one program execution or http request.
- **Projects** allow you to define common settings used across runs.

## Create a project

To create a project, sign in to the [dashboard](https://app.observation.tools/), click "Create project", give your
project a name, and hit "Create".

Below your project's name will be an ID that you'll need to initialize the observation.tools client. Project IDs
are not sensitive, so you can embed them in your source code.

## Install a client library

        ```sh
        pnpm add @observation-tools/client
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Export your data

To start exporting data from your program, we need to set up a client for your project and create a run. After
that, we can create groups to organize artifacts during different parts of our program and export artifacts.

<Tabs groupId="code">
    <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

        ```rust
        let client = observation_tools_client::Client::new(ClientOptions {
        ui_host,
        api_host,
        project_id,
        client: None,
        token_generator: TokenGenerator::Constant(auth_token),
    })?;

        let run_uploader = client.create_run("examples")?;
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Visualize your data

When you run your program, you'll be asked to sign in (for other options, see [authentication](/docs/authentication)).

After you sign in, your program will create a new run and print out a URL. Open it to see data as the program runs.
