//!
//! # Quickstart
//!
//! Observation Tools helps you quickly inspect complex data without needing to
//! build your own visualization tools.
//!
//! Integrating Observation Tools into your program takes about 5 minutes. You
//! need to:
//!
//! 1. Create a project
//! 2. Install a client library
//! 3. Export your data
//! 5. Visualize your data
//!
//! ### Organizing your data
//!
//! We use four different concepts to organize your data:
//!
//! - **Artifacts** are individual pieces of data, e.g. an image
//! - **Artifact groups** help organize artifacts and can define how artifacts
//!   can be visualized together.
//! - **Runs** are the top level artifact groups. The normally correspond to one
//!   program execution or http request.
//! - **Projects** allow you to define common settings used across runs.
//!
//! ## Create a project
//!
//! All data uploaded to Observation Tools is associated with a project.
//! Projects have a unique ID that you'll use to initialize the client in the
//! next step.
//!
//! To create a project, do the following:
//! 1. Sign in to the [dashboard](https://app.observation.tools/)
//! 1. Click "Create project"
//!
//! You should see your project's ID on the following screen. You can also find
//! it on the "Settings" page. Project IDs are not sensitive, so you can embed
//! them in your source code.
//!
//! ## Install a client library
//!
//! We have client libraries for a few different languages:
//!
//! | Language | Package | Version|
//! |----------|---------| -------|
//! | Rust     | `observation-tools` | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/observation-tools)](https://crates.io/crates/observation-tools) |
//! | JavaScript **experimental** | `@observation-tools/client` | [![npm(scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40observation-tools/client)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@observation-tools/client) |
//!
//! Don't see the language you're looking for? Let us know! File a [feature request](https://github.com/Dig-Doug/observation-tools-client/issues) or [email us](mailto:help@observation.tools).
//!
//! Install the Rust client with the following command:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo add observation-tools
//! ```
//!
//! ## Export your data
//!
//! To start exporting data from your program, we need to set up a client for
//! your project and create a run. After that, we can create groups to organize
//! artifacts during different parts of our program and export artifacts:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use observation_tools::artifacts::Point2Builder;
//! use observation_tools::artifacts::Segment2Builder;
//! use observation_tools::Client;
//! use observation_tools::ClientOptions;
//! use observation_tools::TokenGenerator;
//!
//! let client = Client::new(
//!     std::env::var("OBSERVATION_TOOLS_PROJECT_ID")?,
//!     ClientOptions::default(),
//! )?;
//!
//! /// The name of the run will show up in the UI. You can optionally add key-value metadata to
//! /// all objects, see [`builders::UserMetadataBuilder::add_metadata`].
//! let run_uploader = client.create_run("getting-started-example")?;
//! /// ArtifactGroups are represented as "uploaders"
//! let uploader_2d = run_uploader.child_uploader_2d("shapes")?;
//! uploader_2d.create_object2(
//!     "segment2",
//!     Segment2Builder::new(Point2Builder::new(-1.0, 1.0), Point2Builder::new(1.0, -1.0)),
//! )?;
//!
//! println!("See the output at: {}", run_uploader.viewer_url());
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! For more information on the types of data you can upload, see the
//! documentation for the [`artifacts`] module.
//!
//! ## Visualize your data
//!
//! To view the exported data, you can either find the run on the [dashboard](https://app.observation.tools/) or generate a direct url with [`groups::RunUploader::viewer_url`].
//!
//! # Examples
//! For more examples, check out the [examples](https://github.com/Dig-Doug/observation-tools-client/tree/main/examples) directory in the repository.
